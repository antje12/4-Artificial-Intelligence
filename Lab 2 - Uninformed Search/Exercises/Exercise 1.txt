Obs! We assume we always read from the front of the list!

1.
Successor nodes are inserted at front of the fringe (successor list) as a node is expanded. 
Is this a breadth (FIFO) or depth first search (LIFO)?
- This would result in a depth-first search (LIFO)

2.
For goal J, give the fringe (successor list) after expanding each node.
A: B,C
B: D,E,C
D: E,C
E: C
C: F,G
F: G
G: H,I,J
H: I,J
I: J
J: -

3.
What is the effect of inserting successor nodes at the end of the fringe as a node is expanded? 
A depth or breadth first search?
- It is breadth-first search (FIFO)

4.
For goal J, give the fringe (successor list) after expanding each node.
A: B,C
B: C,D,E
C: D,E,F,G
D: E,F,G
E: F,G
F: G
G: H,I,J
H: I,J
I: J
J: -
