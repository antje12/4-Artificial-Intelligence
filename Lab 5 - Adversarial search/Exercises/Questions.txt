1. What is the branching factor at depth 0? At depth 1?
- At depth 0 the branching factor is 9
- At depth 1 the branching factor is 8

2. What is the maximal depth?
- The max depth is when the complete board is full, which is after 9 moves

3. Will a MIN move attempt to minimize or maximize the utility?
- Min move will minimize the utility

4. Are states after a terminal state explored?
- At a terminal state we stop exploring

5. Are all possible states explored to a terminal state?
- Yes, unless we use Aplha-Beta pruning

6. Is this a depth first or breadth first search? How do you know? (see Python code)
- This is a depth first search.
