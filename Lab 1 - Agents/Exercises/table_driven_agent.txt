2: The result was:
- None     [('A', 'Clean'), ('A', 'Dirty'), ('B', 'Clean'), ('B', 'Clean')]
The table did not contain a case for the percept sequence:
- ('A', 'Clean'), ('A', 'Dirty'), ('B', 'Clean'), ('B', 'Clean')
Which is why it gets the default output "None"

3: If we only look at the current percept, we would only require 4 table entries:
- ((A, "Dirty"),): "Clean"
- ((A, "Clean"),): "Right"
- ((B, "Dirty"),): "Clean"
- ((B, "Clean"),): "Left"

4: If we keep the history table, it would have to contain 4^T table entries for an agent lifetime og T steps.
