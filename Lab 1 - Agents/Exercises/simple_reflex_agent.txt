3:
Change the SIMPLE_REFLEX_AGENT condition-action rules to return bogus actions, 
such as Left when should go Right, or Crash, etc. 
Rerun the agent. 
Do the Actuators allow bogus actions?
- If we return bogus actions, as suggested, the agent will never leave its current space.
Hereby it will never come into contact with the rest of the environment (other spaces).
This makes it impossible for the agent to fulfill its function on the environment.
So yes, they do allow bogus actions, but it will hinder agent progress
