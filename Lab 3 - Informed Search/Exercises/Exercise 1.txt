Greedy best search - Solution path:
State: K - Depth: 3
State: H - Depth: 2
State: D - Depth: 1
State: A - Depth: 0

A* search - Solution path:
State: L - Depth: 3
State: H - Depth: 2
State: D - Depth: 1
State: A - Depth: 0

Compare the solution paths:
As can be seen there are 2 different solution paths.
The 2 paths diverge on the last step, where the goal node is selected.
- The greedy best fist algorithm selected K as the goal node, which is more expensive to reach, since the travel distance from H to K is 6.
- The A* algorithm selected L as the goal node, which is cheaper to reach, since the travel distance from H to L is only 5.
