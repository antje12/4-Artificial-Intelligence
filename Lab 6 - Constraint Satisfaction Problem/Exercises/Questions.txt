See the attached file constraints.py, it contains a Python program to solve constraint satisfaction problems
1. What is returned by create_australia_csp()
- The problem definition consisting of:
-- The variables (X)
-- The domain for each variable (D)
-- The arcs between the variables
-- The constraint function (C)

2. What is returned by backtracking_search()
- The function returns the solution, i.e. 
A complete assignment that satisfies all constraints:
-- NSW: Blue
-- NT: Blue
-- Q: Red
-- SA: Green
-- T: Red
-- V: Red
-- WA: Red

3. What is the purpose of assignment variable?
- The assignment variable contains 
the dictionary of domain values currently assigned to variables
- We can add or remove assignments to this collection
- The assignments that have been set to the variables

4. What is the purpose of variable variable?
- The variable variable is the next variable that we want to assign a value to i.e. 
This is a variable that is not yet in the assignment collection

5. What is the purpose of the following statement?
	for value in self.order_domain_values(variable, assignment)
- For each possible value in the domain i.e.
For each color that can be set on the variable

6. What would the following do?
	if self.is_consistent('Q': 'Red', 'NT': 'Blue', 'NSW': 'Green'):
		assignment[variable] = value
- Hvis farven i value ikke bryder consistency bliver den sat på vores variabel
- I dette tilfælde får vi en fejl!
-- Hvis Q = Red, NT = Blue, og NSW = Green, så vil vi ikke kunne farve SA

7. What would then assignment be?
- assignment would stay unchanged

8. What is the effect of del assignment[variable]
- We remove an assignmen that has been set to a variable
